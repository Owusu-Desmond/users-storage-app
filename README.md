# users-storage-app

Users storage app is a server side web application with user authentication, admin page for registered users and a sample store where users can items for later purchase (i.e. a "Cart")

The key idea here is to create a simple CRUD application

- [ ] Traditional CRUD application.
- [ ] Create, Read, Update and Delete.
- [ ] Extra : Forget Password Flow.
- [ ] Authomated Email Sending (Mailgun).

## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, Yarn, installed in your environement.

### Node

- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
  Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems

  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

  If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

      $ node --version
      v8.11.3

      $ npm --version
      6.1.0

  If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

  $ npm install npm -g

### Yarn installation

After installing node, this project will need yarn too, so just run the following command.

      $ npm install -g yarn
